# Spo-Tinder

One day, I was reminiscing about how addictive the design of some apps is, and was trying to figure out how I could mimic it with a unique spin. Then, I came up with an idea: the Tinder layout but for Spotify tracks. After several hours of typing, freaking out over how terrible the Spotify API is, and metaphorical tears being shed, I present to you Spo-Tinder! Get matched to different songs and add them to a playlist to listen to!
